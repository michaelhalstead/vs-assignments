                <p>Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Yes, I saw. You were
                    doing well, until everyone died. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! No argument here.</p>
                <p>Belligerent and numerous. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! We're rescuing ya. Quite possible. We
                    live long and are celebrated poopers. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal
                    with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</p>
                <p>Ummm…to eBay? Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Yes, I saw. You
                    were doing well, until everyone died. Who am I making this out to?</p>
                <p>Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot
                    Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. Professor, make a woman out of me. Large bet on
                    myself in round one.</p>
                <p>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! What are their names? No. We're on the top. Interesting.
                    No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER
                    ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>

                <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show
                    to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make
                    more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred
                    in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>

                <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular
                    gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes
                    with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. </p>

                <p>Epic cheeseburgers come in all kinds of manifestations, but we want them in and around our mouth no matter
                    what. Slide those smashed patties with the gently caramelized meat fat between a toasted brioche bun
                    and pass it over. You fall in love with the cheeseburger itself but the journey ain’t half bad either.</p>
                <p>They’re the childhood friend that knows your highest highs and lowest lows. They’ve been with you through
                    thick and thin and they’re the best at keeping secrets. Whether it’s dressed up or informal, cheeseburgers
                    have your back.
                </p>
                <p>Sometimes we lose sight of what really matters in life. There’s something to be said for a gourmet brie and
                    truffle burger paired with parmesan frites, but don’t let that make you forget about the ol’ faithful
                    with American cheddar and a squishy bun. Lettuce remind you that cheeseburgers come in all forms - bun
                    intended.
                </p>
                <p>Pop quiz: what’s the greatest thing to happen to your mind, body, and soul in recent history? A cheeseburger,
                    obviously. Cheeseburgers know that what you want can also be what you need.</p>
