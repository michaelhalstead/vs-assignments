                <p>My name is Bender. Recently, I've found that people aren't too obliged to 'bite my shiny metal ass' when
                    I tell them to. I'm looking for a someone who would like to bit my shiny metal ass. Of course, there
                    is no charge. Just looking for new connections.</p>

                <span class="alert">BREAKING:</span> Characters spout random crap!</h3>
            <p>Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling
                a death sphere? Look, last night was a mistake. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would
                be it. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding
                Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Negative, bossy
                meat creature! Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! OK, this has gotta
                stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Yes, I saw. You were doing well,
                until everyone died. Bender?! You stole the atom. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord
                with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big
                "B"? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's
                it. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Who are you, my warranty?! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
                Say what? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Fry, you can't just sit here in
                the dark listening to classical music.
                <i>That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch.</i> If I could just learn to play this stupid
                thing. You know, I was God once. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Hello Morbo, how's the
                family? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue
                and lament it. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your
                good vestments." Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!
                And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. A sexy mistake. I never loved you. We
                don't have a brig. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside
                your head." Throw her in the brig. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants.</p>

            <p>What am I, the pope? Large bet on myself in round one. Guess again. Now what? You're going to do his laundry?
                You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Who am I making this out to? We'll need to have a look inside you with
                this camera. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Ah, yes! John Quincy
                Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. But I've
                never been to the moon! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Hello
                Morbo, how's the family? No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! When will that
                be? No! The cat shelter's on to me. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little
                food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have
                no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… There's one way and
                only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! No, of course not. It was… uh…
                porno. Yeah, that's it. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Can we have Bender Burgers again?
                Really?! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Also Zoidberg. I was all of history's great robot actors
                - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!
                <strong>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</strong> Oh, I
                always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Pansy. Would you censor
                the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! But,
                like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. What kind of a father would I be if I said
                no? I wish! It's a nickel. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. We're rescuing ya. I never loved
                you. It must be wonderful. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Does
                anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Can we have Bender Burgers again? Hello, little man. I
                will destroy you! Ask her how her day was. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Um, is this
                the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p>
