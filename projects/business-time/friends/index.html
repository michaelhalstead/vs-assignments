It's no miracle either, as the people behind Beanie Brigade are nothing short of genuine, caring, and honest people who want nothing less for the music scene than to see it thrive. I rarely have seen a single booking company bring so many things to the table so quickly. Beanie Brigade has a solid draw and never leaves their bands hungry or broke when they leave the venue and continuously promotes every show until their fingers bleed. The blood, sweat, and tears Beanie Brigade has put into their work is unfathomable, making them an amazing group of people to work with. In the time Beanie Brigade has been active, they have consistently delivered quality shows to the residents of the Rogue Valley and beyond. It is so important to our music scene and our community to have something as special and committed as Beanie Brigade to making sure quality art is heard and remembered.",

But from the moment we reached the venue I knew that this show was going to be something special. As a small band a lot of shows we play the promoters usually provide us with the bare minimum, however Beanie Brigade exceeded any expectation I had of the Southern Oregon music scene. From start to finish we had a blast not only playing, but getting to know the scene. It is a really special feeling knowing that you're cared for, especially hundreds of miles from home and I have never felt that as much as I did at the Eaden Ballroom. Because of this our show in Grants Pass was a highlight of tour. I have nothing but good things to say about Beanie Brigade and I hope to play there again soon.",

Our first show with them was after a couple cancellations on our first real tour, so we were grateful to even have a venue to play in the first place. Not only did the BB team have a professional sound crew and great street promotion, they fed every band that performed that night. The show we played had the best turnout and crowd of our tour! We were all stoked when Kevin asked us back for another show last month.",
